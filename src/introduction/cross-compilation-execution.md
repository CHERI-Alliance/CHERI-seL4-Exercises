# Cross compilation and execution

### Building a cross build environment with cheribuild

First, clone the cheribuild repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribuild.git -b std-cheri-riscv-microkit
```
The [README.md](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribuild/blob/master/README.md) file contains considerable information, but to get started, you'll need to bootstrap an LLVM compiler and a CHERI-Microkit build.
Make sure you install all host dependencies for cheribuild, and [Microkit](https://github.com/seL4/microkit/blob/main/README.md) (mainly Rust and libxml2-utils) first. Those could be found in their READMEs. For instance, on Debian-like Linux distributions, install
the followings for Microkit.

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
apt install libxml2-utils
```

After you install the host dependencies, you can then build the CHERI-Microkit SDK. This will build LLVM, QEMU, OpenSBI, CHERI-seL4, and CHERI-Microkit. The easiest path to doing this is:
```
cheribuild.py cheri-microkit-baremetal-riscv64-zpurecap --cheri-microkit/build_all -d
```
This will churn away, prompting occasionally as it bootstraps assorted dependencies. It should build SDKs to get CHERI-LLVM, CHERI-QEMU, CHERI-GDB, RISC-V's OpenSBI, CHERI-seL4, and CHERI-Microkit SDK.
<!-- XXX: Should we advocate `-f` here? -->
Upon completion, you will find a usable Clang compiler in `~/cheri/output/cheri-alliance-sdk/bin/clang` and a CHERI-Microkit SDK in `~/cheri/output/cheri-alliance-sdk/baremetal/baremetal-riscv64-zpurecap/microkit-sdk-2.0.1-dev` (unless you have altered `cheribuild`'s default paths).

## Compiler command line
In this set of exercises we cross compile in two basic modes.
Conventional RISC-V ABI and the pure-capability ABI.

### Common elements
All command lines will share some comment elements to target 64-bit RISC-V, select the linker, and indicate where to find the CHERI-Microkit SDK.

Some conventions:
 - `$MICROKIT_SDK` is the path to your CHERI-Microkit SDK.
 - `MICROKIT_TOOL` `$(MICROKIT_SDK)/bin/microkit` is a host tool to package and generate a single CHERI-Microkit bootable image.
 - `$MICROKIT_CONFIG` is the build config for CHERI-Microkit. This could/should always be just "cheri".
 - `$CHERISDK_BINDIR` `~/cheri/output/cheri-alliance-sdk/bin/` (unless you have altered `cheribuild`'s default paths).
 - `$BOARD` is the platform to build CHERI-Microkit for. This should be `qemu_virt_riscv64` for running on QEMU.
 - `$CLANG` is the path to your compiler, eg `$CHERISDK_BINDIR/clang`.
 - All compiler commands begin with `$CLANG -target riscv64-unknown-elf -fuse-ld=lld -mno-relax`
 - As a rule, you will want to add `-g` to the command line to compile with debug symbols.
 - You will generally want to compile with `-O2` as the unoptimized assembly is verbose and hard to follow.
 - We strongly recommend you compile with warnings on including `-Wall` and `-Wcheri`.

### RISC-V
Two additional arguments are required to specify the supported architectural features and ABI.  For conventional RISC-V, those are: `
-march=rv64gc -mabi=lp64d`.
Putting it all together:
```
$CLANG -g -O2 -target riscv64-unknown-elf -fuse-ld=lld -mno-relax -march=rv64gc -mabi=lp64d -Wall -Wcheri
```
### CHERI-RISC-V (purecap)
For CHERI-RISC-V, the architecture and ABI flags are:
`-march=rv64gc_zcherihybrid -mabi=l64pc128d`.
Putting it all together:
```
$CLANG -g -O2 -target riscv64-unknown-elf -fuse-ld=lld -mno-relax -march=rv64gc_zcherihybrid -mabi=l64pc128d -Wall -Wcheri
```

## Executing binaries
CHERI-Microkit supports running RISC-V and CHERI-RISC-V side-by-side on the same instance, so provided the instance has all features available for the exercise or mission in question, you should be able to complete it on a single CHERI-Microkit instance.

CHERI-LLVM and the elfutils also recognise the relevant ELF flags. For example, CHERI-LLVM on the host used for cross-compiling will report:
```
# llvm-readelf -h riscv-binary | grep Flags
  Flags:                             0x5, RVC, double-float ABI
# llvm-readelf -h cheri-binary | grep Flags
  Flags:                             0x30005, RVC, double-float ABI, cheriabi, capability mode
```

In CHERI-Microkit, a host tool is run to package and generate a single bootable binary image that contains an ELF loader, the CHERI-seL4 microkernel, Microkit's run-time libraries, and user ELFs (protection domains) with an XML security policy file. This single image gets loaded at run-time and executes
after OpenSBI (acting as a bios) for RISC-V. For each exercise here, we will need to cross-compile it as a user ELF (Microkit's protection domain), generate an entire system binary image, then load and run it (on QEMU). An example sequence of doing that looks like:
```
# $CLANG -g -O2 -target riscv64-unknown-elf -fuse-ld=lld -mno-relax -march=rv64gc_zcherihybrid -mabi=l64pc128d -Wall -Wcheri --sysroot=$MICROKIT_SDK/board/$BOARD/$MICROKIT_CONFIG -Tmicrokit.ld -nostdlib -ffreestanding -lmicrokit_purecap -lutils_purecap $EXERCISE.c -o $EXERCISE.elf
# $MICROKIT_TOOL $(EXERCISE).system --search-path $(BUILD_DIR) --board $(BOARD) --config $(MICROKIT_CONFIG) -o $(IMAGE_FILE) -r $(REPORT_FILE)
# $CHERISDK_BINDIR/qemu-system-riscv64cheri -machine virt -cpu codasip-a730 -serial mon:stdio -nographic -smp 1 -m size=2G -kernel $(IMAGE_FILE)
```

In the following section, we provide helper scripts to easily build and run the exercises on QEMU to use at your convenience. Those scripts automate the above commands so that you don't need to type them every time you change an exercise.
