   ```

   Using GDB or llvm-objdump to see what instructions at the faulting PC (ip=0x000200060), we see:
   ```
   ;       buf[ix] = 'b';
   200060: 23 00 b5 00   sb      a1, 0(ca0)
   ```

   If we investigate the content of `ca0` (either using GDB's `info reg $ca0` or from the register dump), we can see it does have something
   like:
   ```
   ca0 : 0x3fffffef30 [rwCM1111,0x3fffffef20-0x3fffffef30]
   ```

   The capability in `ca0`, which is a pointer into the `lower` buffer, has been
   taken beyond the end of the allocation, as out of bounds store has been
   attempted (`Bounds violation`).

   But where did those bounds originate?  Heading `up` a stack frame and
   `disass`embling, we see (eliding irrelevant instructions):
   ```
	(gdb) up
    #1  0x00000000002000ea in init () at buffer-overflow-stack.c:31
	31              write_buf(lower, sizeof(lower));

	=> 0x00000000002000ea <+132>:   lbu     a0,64(csp)
   ```
   The compiler has arranged for `init` to allocate 128 bytes on the stack by
   decrementing the *capability stack pointer* register (`csp`) by 128 bytes.
   Further, the compiler has placed `lower` 48 bytes up into that allocation:
   `ca0` is made to point at its lowest address and then the pointer to `lower`
   is materialized in `cs0` by *bounding* the capability in `ca0` to be 16
   (`sizeof(lower)`) bytes long.  This capability is passed to `write_buf` in
   `ca0`.

4. The code for `write_buf` function is only slightly changed.  On
   RISC-V it compiles to
   ```
    20004c <write_buf>:
    20004c: 2e 95         add     a0, a0, a1
    20004e: 93 05 20 06   li      a1, 98
    200052: 23 00 b5 00   sb      a1, 0(a0)
    200056: 82 80         ret
   ```
   while on CHERI-RISC-V, it is
   ```
    200058 <write_buf>:
    200058: 33 05 b5 0c   cadd    ca0, ca0, a1
    20005c: 93 05 20 06   li      a1, 98
    200060: 23 00 b5 00   sb      a1, 0(ca0)
    200064: 82 80         ret
   ```
   In both cases, it amounts to displacing the pointer passed in `a0` (resp.
   `ca0`) by the offset passed in `a1` and then performing a store-byte
   instruction before returning.  In the baseline case, the store-byte takes an
   *integer* address for its store, while in the CHERI case, the store-byte takes
   a *capability authorizing the store*.  There are no conditional branches or
   overt bounds checks in the CHERI instruction stream; rather, the `sb`
   instruction itself enforces the requirement for authority to write to memory,
   in the shape of a valid, in-bounds capability.

   We have already seen the CHERI program's call site to `write_buf` in `init`,
   and the derivation of the capability to the `lower` buffer, above.  In the
   baseline version, the corresponding instructions are shown as
   ```
    Breakpoint 1, init () at buffer-overflow-stack.c:23
    23                  upper, lower, (size_t)(upper - lower));
    (gdb) disassemble init
    Dump of assembler code for function init:
       0x0000000000200058 <+0>:     addi    sp,sp,-48

       0x00000000002000c0 <+104>:   mv      a0,sp
       0x00000000002000c2 <+106>:   li      a1,16
       0x00000000002000c4 <+108>:   auipc   ra,0x0
       0x00000000002000c8 <+112>:   jalr    -120(ra) # 0x20004c <write_buf>

   ```

   Here, the compiler has reserved only 48 bytes of stack space and has placed the
   `lower` buffer at the lowest bytes of this reservation.  Thus, to pass a
   pointer to the `lower` buffer to `write_buf`, the program simply copies the
   stack pointer register (an *integer* register, holding an *address*) to the
   argument register `a0`.  The subsequent address arithmetic derives an address
   out of bounds, clobbering a byte of the `upper` register.
